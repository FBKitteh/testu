                right here <br>
                we want to watch <br>
                and as we gaze <br>
                into the void <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv1">
                    the person we observe the thoughts here is staring off into space, possibly due to boredom
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis2">
                we stare down <br>
                and watch as we <br>
                turn into what <br>
                we swore destroyed <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv2">
                    it seems as though this person is seeing something they previously thought they had destroyed in the void that they're staring at
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis3">
                there it is <br>
                hard to see <br>
                peering close <br>
                we set it free <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv3">
                    this person is saying that whatever they thought they had destroyed has now been set free
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis4">
                what is there <br>
                to do now <br>
                why don't we <br>
                simply find out <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv4">
                    now that they've set this thing free, they're still unsatisfied and bored, so they look for something to do
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis5">
                and here we wait <br>
                by the sea <br>
                to observe the waves <br>
                and thus we stay <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv5">
                    they're sitting and watching the sea because they might be lacking friends, so the only reason they keep doing this is because since they have nothing better do to
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis6">
                and here we wait <br>
                by the sea <br>
                to observe the waves <br>
                and thus we stay <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv6">
                    the previous line is emphasized by a second use, further increasing the chance that they're lonely and bored
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis7">
                so when we run away from this place <br>
                will you <br>
                stay with me whereabout i shall go <br>
                please do <br>

                <p class="p_inv7">
                    suddenly, this person is talking to someone who wasn't there before, and asking them to come and stay with them
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="p_vis8">
                all i want from you is the voice from <br>
                your lips <br>
                speaking those words softly to me <br>
                all night <br>
                <br>
                <p class="p_inv8">
                    this line shows the possibility that this other person is someone who is loved dearly by the main character of this story, maybe a signifigant other

            </p>
            <p class="p_vis9">
                i watch you grasp my hand between <br>
                your palms <br>
                is it too much to ask for more <br>
                hope not <br>

                <p class="p_inv9">
                    this reinforces the previous statement that this might be a signifigant other, and the main character wants to go further with their relationship

            </p>
            <p class="p_vis10">
                when i spend time with you it is <br>
                well spent <br>

                to keep <br>

                <p class="p_inv10">
                    this person really enjoys spending time with their signifigant other, and they state that here

                <p class="p_inv11">
                    the main character starts to restate lines here, for a strange unknown reason

                    currently formulating a reason to explain the restating of these lines

                <p class="p_inv14">
                    for some reason, the main character keeps saying these lines over again; its possible something is keeping them in a tranced state

                <p class="p_inv15">
                    in addition to the last statement, constant reiteration of these lines just makes it more likely that the previous statements are true

                    the next two lines are skipped for some strange reason, possibly something happens to the main character, making them realize they can't just keep repeating the same things

                    for some reason, the second character doesn't show up at times, and yet the main character still knows that they're there

                    suddenly the main character reveals that the second character is simply a creation of their own mind, bringing up many questions

                    the main character begins blaming the fake existance of the second character on them, even though in reality, it's their own fault since they created them

                    this person starts questioning theirself, wondering how they could've ever tricked themself into believing their own lie

                <p class="p_inv21">
                    the character begins lamenting about the fact that the second character doesn't truly exist, and wishes that they did

                    the main character eventually strives to forget about this creation of the mind, likely to start caring about things in real life
